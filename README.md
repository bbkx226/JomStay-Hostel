## Assignment Question

- Design and implement a Hostel Management System
- Target users: admin and student
- Admin can perform basic operations: create, read, update, delete
- Students can make reservations through the system
- Use object-oriented approach to design and develop the system
- Supporting document required to reflect design and implementation details
- Document should demonstrate object-oriented programming concepts with code samples

This coursework requires students to identify the problem domain for a hostel management process and construct a software solution using object-oriented programming paradigm. The developed system should achieve the following requirements for different types of users but not limited to:

1.Admin

- System login record for authentication and authorisation process
- Add/update/read/delete hostel room information
- Manage students’ hostel application
- Check students’ record
- Generate report such as monthly income, number of rooms available, etc.
  2.Student
- System login record for authentication and authorisation process
- Make hostel application
- Check and read information for available hostel room
- Track personal application and historical record
- Make payment

With the aforementioned requirements, you are expected to analyse the problem domain pertaining to a hostel management process. All the information must be saved in text file. Apart from these, the general settings and data configuration as well as fundamental functions are included to facilitate the end users.

You are also required to identify the relationship among the entities and also develop the necessary methods needed to fulfil the requirements of the expected systems.

## Requirements

- The program submitted should compile and be executed without errors.
- Validation for input should be done for each entry from the users to avoid logical errors.
- The implementation code must highlight the use of object-oriented programming concepts as required by the solution.
- Students should use text files for storing and retrieving data required for the system.
- Not allowed to use any database tools like access / oracle etc.
